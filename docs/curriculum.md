# Training with Curriculum Learning

## Background

Curriculum learning is a way of training a machine learning model where more difficult 
aspects of a problem are gradually introduced in such a way that the model is always 
optimally challenged. Here is a link to the original paper which introduces the ideal 
formally. More generally, this idea has been around much longer, for it is how we humans 
typically learn. If you imagine any childhood primary school education, there is an 
ordering of classes and topics. Arithmetic is taught before algebra, for example. 
Likewise, algebra is taught before calculus. The skills and knowledge learned in the 
earlier subjects provide a scaffolding for later lessons. The same principle can be 
applied to machine learning, where training on easier tasks can provide a scaffolding 
for harder tasks in the future.

_Example of a mathematics curriculum. Lessons progress from simpler topics to more 
complex ones, with each building on the last._

When we think about how Reinforcement Learning actually works, the primary learning 
signal is a scalar reward received occasionally throughout training. In more complex 
or difficult tasks, this reward can often be sparse, and rarely achieved. For example, 
imagine a task in which an agent needs to scale a wall to arrive at a goal. The starting 
point when training an agent to accomplish this task will be a random policy. That 
starting policy will have the agent running in circles, and will likely never, or very 
rarely scale the wall properly to the achieve the reward. If we start with a simpler 
task, such as moving toward an unobstructed goal, then the agent can easily learn to 
accomplish the task. From there, we can slowly add to the difficulty of the task by 
increasing the size of the wall, until the agent can complete the initially 
near-impossible task of scaling the wall. We are including just such an environment with 
ML-Agents 0.2, called Wall Area.

_Demonstration of a curriculum training scenario in which a progressively taller wall 
obstructs the path to the goal._
 
To see this in action, observe the two learning curves below. Each displays the reward 
over time for an agent trained using PPO with the same set of training hyperparameters. 
The difference is that the agent on the left was trained using the full-height wall 
version of the task, and the right agent was trained using the curriculum version of 
the task. As you can see, without using curriculum learning the agent has a lot of 
difficulty. We think that by using well-crafted curricula, agents trained using 
reinforcement learning will be able to accomplish tasks otherwise much more difficult.

## How-To
 
So how does it work? In order to define a curriculum, the first step is to decide which 
parameters of the environment will vary. In the case of the Wall Area environment, what 
varies is the height of the wall. We can define this as a reset parameter in the Academy 
object of our scene, and by doing so it becomes adjustable via the Python API. Rather 
than adjusting it by hand, we then create a simple JSON file which describes the 
structure of the curriculum. Within it we can set at what points in the training process 
our wall height will change, either based on the percentage of training steps which have 
taken place, or what the average reward the agent has received in the recent past is. 
Once these are in place, we simply launch ppo.py using the `â€“curriculum-file` flag to 
point to the JSON file, and PPO we will train using Curriculum Learning. Of course we can 
then keep track of the current lesson and progress via TensorBoard.


```json
{
    "measure" : "reward",
    "thresholds" : [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
    "min_lesson_length" : 2,
    "signal_smoothing" : true, 
    "parameters" : 
    {
        "min_wall_height" : [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5],
        "max_wall_height" : [1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0]
    }
}
```

* `measure` - What to measure learning progress, and advancement in lessons by.
    * `reward` - Uses a measure received reward. 
    * `progress` - Uses ratio of steps/max_steps.
* `thresholds` (float array) - Points in value of `measure` where lesson should be increased.
* `min_lesson_length` (int) - How many times the progress measure should be reported before 
incrementing the lesson.
* `signal_smoothing` (true/false) - Whether to weight the current progress measure by previous values.
    * If `true`, weighting will be 0.75 (new) 0.25 (old).
* `parameters` (dictionary of key:string, value:float array) - Corresponds to academy reset parameters to control. Length of each array
should be one greater than number of thresholds.
