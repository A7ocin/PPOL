PHOTOBOOOTH

Photobooth is a tool for generating thumbnail sprites for Wardrobe recipes.

These can be used in the user interface so users see a list of preview images for the wardrobe items rather than the sliders, which I think is more user friendly..

TO USE

Drag the PhotoBooth prefab into the Scene and set it up with the Avatar you want to take photos of.
