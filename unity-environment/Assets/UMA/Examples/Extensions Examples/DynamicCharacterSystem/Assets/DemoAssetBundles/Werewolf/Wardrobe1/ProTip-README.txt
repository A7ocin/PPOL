By including a texture that is required by the baseRecipe in this AssetBundle you can force this bundle to also be downloaded when the race is downloaded.
We have done this here by including 'WerewolfTeeth_Diffuse' in this bundle and this is what makes the 'WerewolfShirt' available when the Werewolf first loads.
