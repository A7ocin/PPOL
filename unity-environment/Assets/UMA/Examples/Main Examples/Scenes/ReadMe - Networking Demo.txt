The purpose of these Demo scenes is to demonstrate one way of using UMA with multiplayer games.
It's not the only way, but an example of what it might look like.

Some things to note:
 - You need to add both scenes to the player settings before playing.
 - You start by running the "UMA Core Demo - Networking Menu" scene.
 - The current text based save format is not meant for real word use in a networked game.
