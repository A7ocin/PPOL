* Open the "UMA Core Tool - ExpressionClipEditor" scene

* Select and enable either the Male_Unified or Female_Unified character

* Arrange the Editor layout so that the Inspector, Animation, and either Scene or Game
view are all visible

* Use the sliders in the Edit Mode Expression Player component on the character to set up
a rough version of your expression. Only the sliders with non-zero values will be included
in the animation clip, but you can always add others later using the Animation view.

* Pressing the Save To Clip button will create a new animation clip of your expression and
set it as active on the Animation component of the character.

* Select the new clip using the popup menu in the Animation view.

* Using the keyframe and curve tools in the Animation tools and the sliders from the Edit
Mode Expression Player edit your animation until you're happy with the playback.

* More information on using the Animation view is available here:
http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Animations.html

* Important: This animation clip is set to the Legacy type, which will work for editing
and the classic Animation component but NOT in the Mecanim Animator component, which
requires Generic type clips. There is an item in UMA/Pose Tools menu for converting
animation clips between Legacy and Generic.
